Thinkful's online data analyst program is a 6 months program that prepares me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I have developed proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib), Tableau, and SQL.
